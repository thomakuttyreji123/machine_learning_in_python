# machine_learning_in_python
This repo contains machine learning notebooks. I will start with basic algorithms like linear regresssion , and sometimes i will include machine learning concepts using python code. This repos will be updated later. The main goal of this repository is for knowledge purpose thats why i didn't included deployements and all such stuffs here. You can find those things in my other repositories. Now following is the content 



#### 1. logistic regression (used uci heart disease data) 
#### 2. Gradient descent implementation from scratch (linear and multiple)  (used boston housing data)
#### 3. Linear Regression - using a kaggle problem statement 
#### 4. Naive Bayes Algorithm
